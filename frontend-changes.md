# Frontend Theme Toggle Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to implement a dark/light theme toggle feature for the Course Materials Assistant frontend.

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/index.html`
- Added theme toggle button with sun/moon SVG icons positioned at the top-right
- Button includes proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- Uses keyboard navigation support (tabindex)

### 2. `frontend/style.css`
- **CSS Variables**: Added comprehensive light theme variables alongside existing dark theme
  - Light theme uses white backgrounds, dark text, and appropriate contrast ratios
  - Dark theme remains the default
- **Smooth Transitions**: Added global transition rules for smooth theme switching
- **Theme Toggle Styling**: Added complete styling for the toggle button including:
  - Fixed positioning in top-right corner
  - Circular design with hover effects
  - Icon animation and transition effects
  - Proper focus states for accessibility

### 3. `frontend/script.js`
- **Theme Management Functions**:
  - `initializeTheme()`: Loads saved theme preference from localStorage
  - `toggleTheme()`: Switches between dark and light themes
  - `setTheme()`: Applies theme and updates UI
  - `updateThemeButton()`: Handles icon switching with smooth animations
- **Event Listeners**: Added click and keyboard event handlers for the toggle button
- **Persistence**: Theme preference is saved to localStorage

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Toggle Button Design
- Circular button positioned in top-right corner
- Sun icon for dark theme (indicates switching to light)
- Moon icon for light theme (indicates switching to dark)
- Smooth rotation animation on toggle
- Responsive hover effects

### 2. Theme Variables
- **Dark Theme** (default):
  - Background: Dark slate colors (#0f172a, #1e293b)
  - Text: Light colors (#f1f5f9, #94a3b8)
  - Surfaces: Dark surfaces with proper contrast
  
- **Light Theme**:
  - Background: White and light grays (#ffffff, #f8fafc)
  - Text: Dark colors (#1e293b, #64748b)
  - Surfaces: Light backgrounds with subtle borders

### 3. Accessibility Features
- Proper ARIA labels that update based on current theme
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter and Space key)
- High contrast ratios maintained in both themes
- Focus indicators for all interactive elements

### 4. Smooth Transitions
- All color changes animated with 0.3s ease transitions
- Icon switching includes scale and opacity animations
- Button includes hover and focus state transitions

### 5. User Experience
- Theme preference persisted in localStorage
- Automatic theme initialization on page load
- Visual feedback with rotation animation on toggle
- Seamless switching without page reload

## Technical Implementation

### Theme Switching Mechanism
- Uses `data-theme` attribute on `<html>` element
- CSS custom properties update automatically based on attribute
- JavaScript manages state and localStorage persistence

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal CSS specificity impact
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Smooth animations without layout thrashing

## Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers supporting CSS custom properties
- Graceful fallback to default dark theme if localStorage is unavailable
- SVG icons ensure scalability across different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements
- System theme preference detection (prefers-color-scheme)
- Additional theme options beyond dark/light
- Theme-specific component variations if needed
